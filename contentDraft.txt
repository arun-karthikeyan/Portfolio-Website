Difference between angular and angular2
Angular 2 has far greater performance than angular 1.x
because of "web workers"
client side parallelization of loading content

I was also wondering wbout ECMA Script / ES5, ES6, typescript

angular2 supports ES6, typescript - wrting in plain js is bullshit
so before learning angular2 we also have to learn about either typescript or ES6
